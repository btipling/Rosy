# Rosy

## Building
This hobby project won't build for anyone else but me and my PC and laptop.

[SDL3](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) dll and lib needed
[KTX](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/KTX-Software/tree/main) dll and lib needed
[vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/) and vcpkg install needed

Assets are not included in the repository and the application will immediately halt without them.

This application is hard coded to run on an Nvidia GPU and Windows 11.
